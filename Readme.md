<h1 align = "Left">Hysteresis: tools for non-functional curves.</h1>


Hysteresis is a library of tools for non-functional curves, with a emphasis on force-deformation hysteresis curves.
While functions only have one direction, non functional curves change direction, making analyzing them difficult.
Some key features of the library include:

* Finding peaks or reversal points in data.
* Numerically finding the slope or area of a curve.
* Resampling curves.
* Comparing Hysteresis made with simialar load protocols.
